    "Welcome to the Sequence Alignment and Peptide Selection **Workflow 1B**. This notebook was implemented to deal with a high number of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (**more than 50,000 proteins**). You will be able to recover protein sequences already aligned and search for conserved regions according to your especifications. The protein sequences are aligned in a weekly basis, so you have information that is updated. Just like Workflow 1A, the peptide's list output can be used in the subsequent workflow. (**Workflow 2: Peptide-HLA Prediction for Conserved SARS-CoV-2 Peptides**) \n",
